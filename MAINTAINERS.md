## What is a maintainer? 

There are different types of maintainers, with different responsibilities, but
all maintainers have 3 things in common:

* They share responsibility in the project's success.
* They have made a long-term, recurring time investment to improve the project.
* They spend that time doing whatever needs to be done, not necessarily what
is the most interesting or fun.

Maintainers are often under-appreciated, because their work is harder to appreciate.
It's easy to appreciate a really cool and technically advanced feature. It's harder
to appreciate the absence of bugs, the slow but steady improvement in stability,
or the reliability of a release process. But those things distinguish a good
project from a great one.


## How are maintainers added?

Maintainers are first and foremost contributors that have shown they are
committed to the long term success of a project. Contributors wanting to become
maintainers are expected to be deeply involved in contributing code, pull
request review, and triage of issues in the project for more than three months.

Just contributing does not make you a maintainer, it is about building trust
with the current maintainers of the project and being a person that they can
depend on and trust to make decisions in the best interest of the project.

Periodically, the existing maintainers curate a list of contributors that have
shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list,
maintainer candidates are selected and proposed on the maintainers mailing list.

After a candidate has been announced on the maintainers mailing list, the
existing maintainers are given five business days to discuss the candidate,
raise objections and cast their vote. Candidates must be approved by at least 66% of the current maintainers by adding their vote on the mailing
list. Only maintainers of the repository that the candidate is proposed for are
allowed to vote.

If a candidate is approved, a maintainer will contact the candidate to invite
the candidate to open a pull request that adds the contributor to the
MAINTAINERS file. The candidate becomes a maintainer once the pull request is
merged.
